# Subnet-Caclulator-1.0

<p>Hi Everyone</p>

<p>I have created this program in Visual C# to help other people get there head around subnetting.  While this is currently only supporting class c network addresses I do plan on creating a version 2.0 (Probably in a seperate repo) that includes class A and B network addressing. </p>

<p>I hope you enjoy this program. </p>
